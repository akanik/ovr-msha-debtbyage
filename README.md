## Mine Safety Debt For WV Gov. Justiceâ€™s Family Companies Grows to $4M

An Ohio Valley ReSource analysis of federal mine safety data shows that the companies belonging to the family of West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice owe $4.3 million in delinquent debt for mine safety violations. That is far more than the companies owed when Justice ran for governor in 2016, when he pledged to make good on such debts. 

The Justice companies still have the highest delinquent mine safety debt in the U.S. mining industry.
